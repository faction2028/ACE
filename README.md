## About Atomicals Core Engine (ACE)

ACE combines a sandboxed AVM (Atomicals Virtual Machine), Layer 3 logic system, secure wallet, high-speed indexer, automation-ready CLI, and cross-platform GUI. It is designed to allow anyone to build decentralized apps, games, marketplaces, DAOs, and permissionless projects on Atomicals.

Every ACE node operates independently, validating all transactions, logic, and assets locally without reliance on external APIs or custodial systems.

## Key Concepts

- **Built for Atomicals**: Purpose-built for the Atomicals Protocol and evolving digital objects
- **Layer 3 Execution**: Flexible application logic transpiled into deterministic AVM bytecode
- **Local Validation**: Full simulation, verification, and execution happen on the user's device
- **Dynamic Apps**: Build evolving NFTs, games, marketplaces, or governance systems
- **Community Governance**: ACE is open-source and governed by consensus among participants
